# StocksDatabase-Sql-h2
Sql database manipulation using Java and the h2 database for Indian stocks

# Introduction

I began with the purpose of developing a database for stock trading and analysis. I opted to use the Api provided by Alpha Vantage which is free but has some constraints (calls per minute, etc.). I decided to download CSV files for stock scrips, so they will remain on my local system. <br>

I intended to use a new, lightweight database that met the criteria (ACID, Referential Integrity, and Small Footprint). H2, HSQLDB, and SQLite were among the light and embeddable databases. I elected to use the H2 database. <br>
It enables this project to have: 
- Full ACID-compliant transactions
- Referential Integrity
<br>
The CSV files retrieved via the Alpha Vantage API are sorted in descending order by date.  I used the Eclipse IDE and the Apache commons-CSV jars to programmatically extract a list of CsvRecords.<br>
To insert the CSV Records, I used H2's JDBC driver to connect to the database and perform SQL queries.

I started with the DDL scripts and made two tables for this. One for stock names and one for a daily history of stock prices. The history table contains an ID column with foreign keys to the master table containing stock names.
<br>
> Note:
>  All the SQL queries used are listed [add this link].
> After that, for inserting the daily data, for each stock, the latest date for that stock was taken
> and records in the CSV files after that date were inserted in the history for each stock and were written this way

## Manual DML and DDL examples:

Everything for H2 only, but probably work for all databases
